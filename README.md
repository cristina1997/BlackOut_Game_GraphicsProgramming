# BlackOut_Game_GraphicsProgramming

**In my project I have included the following criteria**

***

**Basic**
  * User interaction 
    - when the left arrow key is pressed, the paddle moves to the left
    - when the right arrow key is pressed, the paddle moves to the right
                  
  * Basic collision detection 
    - every time the ball(s) hits the paddle, the console lets the user know that the ball(s) touched the paddle
    - every time the ball(s) hits a brick, the console lets the user know the brick was hit
  * Cartesian to polar coordinates 
    - used to create the pizza lines
  * Illustration of 
    - movement;
      + the ball(s) bounce off the walls, off the bricks and off the paddle
    - scaling; 
      + the ball(s) size increases until the radius reaches a certain value
    - rotation of objects 
      + the ball(s) rotate around their own center
  * Multiple moving objects 
    - there are 2 balls that the user has to prevent from hitting the bottom of the canvas
  * Sprites 
    - the bricks have an image set to them, when a brick is hit, the brick dissapears with its image

**Advanced**
  * Collision reactions 
    - the ball(s) bounce(s) back when hitting the paddle
    - the ball(s) bounce(s) back when hitting a brick
  * Polygon collision detection 
    - the collision between the ball(s) and the paddle as well as the brick(s)
